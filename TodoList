GetPR:
- Allow querying using extent object

downloadPR:
- better document the fact that a list of path/rows can be used instead of the standard object (See mail from Valerio)

warpVCF:
- Find a way to deal with overlapping areas (first warp without stiching together, then mosaic using mosaic{raster})
- Intermediary should as much as possible be writted to integer (should be flexible based on the data range)
