General:
- Implement a gap filling module that fills remaining clouds with the MODIS vcf

GetPR:
- Allow querying using extent object
- Does not work in all systems certainly due to some +latlong vs +longlat problem

downloadPR:
- better document the fact that a list of path/rows can be used instead of the standard object (See mail from Valerio)

warp/warpVCF:
- Intermediary should as much as possible be written to integer (should be flexible based on the data range)
